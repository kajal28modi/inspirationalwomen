        <h3>News Anchoring</h3>
        <p>Majoring in Speech Communications and Performing Art, Winfrey got her first job as a news co-anchor at Nashville's WLAC-TV stations. Astoundingly, she became the youngest person and the first African-American woman to anchor the news at Nashville's WTVF-TV. Since she wanted to find work in a larger market outside of Nashville, she got a job at WJZ-TV in Baltimore, Maryland as a news anchor. Unfortunately, she was sexually harassed and humiliated at her job, according to DailyWorth. Additionally, she was fired seven and a half months after joining.</p>

        <h3>Talk Shows</h3>
        <p>In 1984, Oprah Winfrey moved to Chicago, Illinois, and became a show anchor on A.M. Chicago, a morning talk show that had low ratings. The impact Oprah made on this show was significant. She changed the entire emphasis of the show from traditional women's issues to current and controversial topics. With Winfrey's lovable attitude and in-depth interview abilities based on empathy, the show quickly skyrocketed to first place. Because of  her immense popularity, King World approached her to take the show into syndication and rename it to "The Oprah Winfrey Show." Although she was hesitant and received little support, she accepted the offer.</p>

        <h3> The Oprah Winfrey Show</h3>
        <p>Her show gained a lot of popularity. "When the episode aired, it was later billed as the fourth most-watched show in U.S. history with 62 million viewers," according to nbcchicago.com. Yet, Oprah started to change the subject matter of her show. From a tabloid talk show format, she changed it to a more personal talk show where she would concentrate more on social issues, self-improvement, spirituality, and charity. She began interviewing political figures and celebrities like Michael Jackson. Winfrey's couch in the show was an icon because this was where guests spilled their secrets and issues. Her career that started with radio and television later branched to filming, book and magazine publishing, and ownership of her television cable network.</p>
